=begin 

do/while loop (loop/break emulates since Ruby doesn't have)
similar to while
but conditional check comes at the end
not the beginning 

 Classic use of this loop is when want to repeatedly perform an action based 
on some condition, but we want the action to be executed at least once no 
matter what.

=end
