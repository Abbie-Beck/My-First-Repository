Controlling loop execution
to prevent things like this which crash systems
insert a break w/ break keyword
(example in exercises)

Break keyword allows us to exit loop at any point
any code after break will not be executed
break does not exit program 
just the loop, then execution on prog resumes

Conditionals w/ loops help specify where and if to exit loop

Use keyword: next 
  to skip over rest of current iteration and pick up execution 
  in the next iteration
  
Break and Next important loop control concepts
used w/ any loop or loop construct in Ruby
when comb w condits, can build simple progs w/ cool behavior

(remember, can't access vars init w/in scope of block outside of block)
