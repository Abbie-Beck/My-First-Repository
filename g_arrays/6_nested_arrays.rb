=begin 

Nested Arrays

arrays able to contain anything
including arrays w/in arrays (arrayception)
for example:


to keep track of all of the teams 
that are in a volleyball tournament 
You might create an array like this:

=end

teams = [['Joe', 'Steve'], ['Frank', 'Molly'], ['Dan', 'Sara']]

# Then you could find the teams by index.

puts teams[1]

=begin 
You could also have an array of hashes too! We won't get into too many 
crazy examples here, but play around with it in irb.
=end
