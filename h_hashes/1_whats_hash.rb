hash is data structure that stores items in keys
arrays store by index
entries called key-value pairs
all key-value pairs in curly braces, sep w/ commas

Hashes can be created with two syntaxes. The older syntax comes with a => sign 
to separate the key and the value.

older syntax goes hash = {:key => 'value'}
newer syntax = {key: 'value'}
