=begin 
not sure yet but looks like the first 
hash would just raise an error because
it is a string and requires the older syntax 
to be used in place of a symbol as a key


ok so the first hash just used x 
instead of taking it as the string
"hi there"
but the second one did
I'm assuming that's because of what 
I said above, the syntax allowing for it


=end
