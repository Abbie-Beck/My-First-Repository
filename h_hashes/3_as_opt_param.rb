Hashes as Optional Parameters

As discussed in chap three on meths
you can assign default params to meths 
so output is consistent. 
can use hash to accept optional params when creating meths also
can help to give methods flexibility and expressivity

(relevant exercise in exercises)

in the exercise, we used the hash method empty?
to figure out if the options parameter (a hash) had any args passed into it
