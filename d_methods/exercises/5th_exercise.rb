Asks what we learn from this error
ArgumentError: wrong number of arguments (1 for 2)
  from (irb):1:in `calculate_product'
  from (irb):4
  from /Users/username/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.5.3/bin/irb:12:in `<main>'
  
  
  We learn that the method 'calculate_product' has been give 1 arg instead of
  its required 2. This occurs on line 4. To fix it we would need to pass the 
  method a second argument.c
