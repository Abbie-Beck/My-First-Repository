Call Stack or 'the stack' bro

helps Ruby keep track of what method is executing 
and where execution should resume when it returns
works kinda like a stack of books where you put 
a new book on top or remove the top book from said stack
puts info about current method on top of stack, 
then removes that info when the method returns.

used also by blocks, procs, lambdas
