Puts v Return: The Sequel!!

Diff betwn puts and rtn

return allows for more explicit instruction on what to return
puts and methods in gen always return eval result of last line
of the expression unless explicit rtn comes before w return keyword
 
 Ruby methods ALWAYS return the evaluated result of the last line of the 
 expression unless an explicit return comes before it.
If you wanted to explicitly return a value you can use the return keyword.
