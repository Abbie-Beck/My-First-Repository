A string is a list of characters in a specific sequence
String literals are written w either double or single quotation marks
Double better for including single quotes within and for string interpolation
String Interpolation is good for merging strings w Ruby code
  basic formula is " #{ruby} expression goes here, or before"

irb :100 > a = 'ten'
=> "ten"

irb :200 > "My favorite number is #{a}!"
=> "My favorite number is ten!"
=end
